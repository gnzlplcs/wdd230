# README.md

This is my personal repository of projects, assignments, tutorials, and useful hacks relating with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and, I hope in a straightaway future, Python.

Many of the repositories is about my BYUI courses' assignments. I have to order them, so that they can be accessed from the main page. Be patient, in a soon future it will be ready.

If you can contact me, I'm always on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnzlplcs) and [Telegram](https://t.me/gnzlplcs).
