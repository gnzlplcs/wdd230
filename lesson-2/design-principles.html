            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <div class="source-link"><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a></div>
            <img src="images/visual-hierarchy-example.jpg" alt="FreeCodeCamp screenshot" class="example-img">
            <p>In this example, clearly, we can appreciate how to apply the Visual Hierarchy principle. The whole page
                has a grey scale colors, but only the start button has an appealing yellow/orange color. This produces
                the user feels tempted to click on it.</p>

        <div class="principles" id="principle2">
            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <div class="source-link">
                <a href="https://www.falabella.com.pe/falabella-pe/" target="_blank">Falabella</a>
            </div>
            <img src="images/hicks-law-example.jpg" alt="Falabella screenshot" class="example-img">
            <p>This image was taken from a local retail site, in Peru. Falabella is a retail that sells a huge amount of
                items, from clothes until furniture. Browsing on its online store can be overwhelming, but they have
                applied the Hick's Law in their site--you can select one category and then another, and so on, until you
                can find the item you search for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="principles" id="principle3">
            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <div class="source-link"><a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a></div>
            <img src="images/proximity-example.jpg" alt="Medium screenshot" class="example-img">
            <p>In this last image, taken from Medium, a well-known platform to share content, we can appreciate a very
                highly neat design, with all of the most important principles: White space, Alignment, Repetition,
                Contrast, etc. However, I want to highlight to the Proximity principle. In each entry you can realize
                that there are a number, the author's name, the post title, the date, and the approaching time you would
                spend reading the post. It's a lot of information, but the space between each entry, and the order and
                proximity of all the elements inside each one, make each post looks clean and invites you to read out.
